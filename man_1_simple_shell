.TH HSH 1 "August 2023" "1.0" "hsh - simple shell man page"
.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.
.SH INVOCATION
If no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal, the shell is considered an interactive shell.
An interactive shell prompts before each command and handles programming and command errors differently.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
When a program is invoked, it is given an array of strings called the environment.
.SH EXIT STATUS
Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the shell to exit with a non-zero exit status.
If the shell is not an interactive shell, the execution of the shell file will be aborted.
Otherwise, the shell will return the exit status of the last command executed, or if the exit builtin is used with a numeric argument, it will return the argument.
.SH EXAMPLES
.BR $ ./hsh
.BR ($) /bin/ls
.BR hsh main.c shell.c
.BR ($)
.BR ($) exit
.BR $
